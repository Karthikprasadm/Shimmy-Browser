HOW TO RUN BROWSEROS BROWSER + BROWSEROS AGENT
=====================================

AGENT SERVER
------------
✅ Default ports (configurable in .env.development):
   - Server HTTP: 9105
   - CDP: 9005
   - WebSocket: 9305
   - Health check: http://localhost:9105/health

To start server:
  cd D:\Shimmy-Browser\Sup-agent
  bun run start:server

To restart server:
  Stop the current process (Ctrl+C) and run start:server again

LOAD EXTENSIONS IN BROWSER
---------------------------
You can test the agent in Chrome, Edge, or any Chromium browser:

1. Open Chrome/Edge
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked"

Load these TWO extensions:

Extension 1 - Agent UI:
  Path: D:\Shimmy-Browser\Sup-agent\apps\agent\dist\chrome-mv3

Extension 2 - Controller:
  Path: D:\Shimmy-Browser\Sup-agent\apps\controller-ext\dist

5. After loading, open the side panel:
   - Click the "Ask BrowserOS" icon in the toolbar, OR
   - Press Alt+A or Alt+K (keyboard shortcuts)

6. The side panel should open with the chat interface

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
------------------
- Alt+A or Alt+K: Toggle AI agent side panel
- Alt+L: Cycle between configured LLM providers

To view/edit shortcuts:
  Go to chrome://extensions/shortcuts

BROWSER (BrowserOS)
-------------------
⚠️ To run the actual BrowserOS browser, you need:
  - Chromium source code (~100GB download)
  - Build it using the build system
  
For now, you can test the agent in regular Chrome/Edge.

TESTING
-------
1. Make sure server is running (port 9105)
   - Check: curl http://localhost:9105/health
   - Should return: {"healthy":true}

2. Load both extensions (Agent UI + Controller)

3. Open side panel:
   - Click extension icon, OR
   - Press Alt+A or Alt+K

4. Configure AI provider:
   - Click extension icon → Options
   - Go to AI Settings
   - Add a provider with a model that supports tool use
   - See validated_agents.md for tested models

5. Try chatting with the AI agent
   - Ask questions or request browser automation tasks
   - Test tool use capabilities

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Server Issues:
- Server not running? Check: curl http://localhost:9105/health
- Port conflicts? Check .env.development and change ports if needed
- WebSocket errors? Verify server is running and ports match config

Extension Issues:
- Extension not loading? Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Side panel not opening? Reload both extensions
- Keyboard shortcuts not working? Check chrome://extensions/shortcuts
- Connection errors? Verify server is on port 9105 (or configured port)

Model Issues:
- "No endpoints found that support tool use"?
  → Model doesn't support function calling
  → Use a model from validated_agents.md
  → Filter OpenRouter models by "tools" parameter

- Rate limiting errors?
  → Free models may have rate limits
  → Wait a few minutes or try a different model

- API key errors?
  → Verify API key is correct and has credits
  → Check key is active in provider dashboard
